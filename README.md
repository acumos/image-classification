# image-classification
A model example for image classification within Cognita.

## Image Classification Tensorflow Use-case (Cognita)
This source code creates and pushes a model into Cognita that processes
incoming images and outputs a number of classification probability values.

## Usage
TBD

## Example Instance
An instance should first be built and downloaded from Cognita and then
launched locally.  Afterwards, the sample application found in 
[video_web_client](video_web_client) uses a `localhost` service to classify
and visualize the results of image classification.
